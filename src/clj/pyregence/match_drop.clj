(defn- parse-available-wx-dates
  "Pares the stdout from a call to `fuel_wx_ign.py`. The exact return structure of this
   call (at the time of this writing in June of 2023) is the following:
   ```
   sig-app@goshawk:~$ ssh sig-app@sierra 'cd /mnt/tahoe/cloudfire/microservices/fuel_wx_ign && ./fuel_wx_ign.py --get_available_wx_times=True'
   Currently available weather times:
   historical- 2011-01-30 00:00 UTC to 2022-09-30 23:00 UTC
   forecast-   2023-06-04 18:00 UTC to 2023-06-21 12:00 UTC
   ```
   Note that even though the above avaialable forecast weather times go out two
   weeks, at the time of writing this function the `fuel_wx_ign.py` script has a
   limitation in that you can only specify a weather start time that is the current
   date. Thus, we manually change the portion of the below response \"2023-06-21\"
   to \"2023-06-07\".

   Example return:
   {:historical {:min-date-iso-str \"2011-01-30T00:00Z\"
                 :max-date-iso-str \"2022-09-30T23:00Z\"}

                 :max-date-iso-str \"2023-06-07T18:00Z\"}

    NOTE: this function is dependent on the exact stdout that `fuel_wx_ign.py` provides.
    In the future, it would be better if the format was more standardized so
    we didn't have to use ugly Regex. For example, we assume that the times are
    always provided in UTC."

(defn- process-response-msg
  "This function is what gets called every time the Pyrecast server recieves a
   message from any one of the Runway servers (e.g. the GridFire Runway server).

   The `msg` argument gets passed in in JSON format and thus needs to be parsed into `response`.
   An example `response-msg-edn` argument can be seen below (would be nice to use spec going forward):

   `{:timestamp '05/11 16:11:02'
     :job-id    '2d30fbed-0fff-40c1-903e-95b02efd6b16'  ; This portion is what we append the server name to throughout `match_drop.clj`
     :status    2
     :message   '(stdout) Some message for an in progress Runway server here...'}`

   The `job-id` corresponds to the `runway-job-id` that the match drop job is
   associated with. The `status` corresponds to the Runway-specific status of the
   job. 0 indicates a completed Runway request, 1 indicates an error, and 2 indicates in-progress.

   From the above Runway `job-id` we can make a request to the SQL database to
   get the info about the match drop job that the initial `response-msg-edn` is associated with."
