* Pyregence

Pyregence is a web portal for displaying near-term fire forecast
results for the state of California. The fire spread and impact maps
are generated by running multiple state-of-the-art simulation models
on a continuously updated stream of weather data.

At this time, Pyregence displays results from these open source fire
behavior models:

1. [[https://github.com/pyregence/elmfire][ELMFIRE]]
2. [[https://github.com/pyregence/gridfire][GridFire]]

** Installation Requirements

- [[https://jdk.java.net][Java Development Kit (version 11+)]]
- [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started][Clojure CLI tools]]
- [[https://www.postgresql.org/download][Postgresql (version 12)]]
- [[https://postgis.net/install][PostGIS (version 3)]]

** Application Configuration

On startup, the Pyregence application reads a file called config.edn
in the toplevel directory of this repository, which contains various
user-configurable system parameters. A sample file called
config.default.edn is provided with this repository to get you
started. To begin, simply rename (or copy) it to config.edn. Then edit
it according to the following sections.

Please note that you must replace all values surrounded with angle
brackets (e.g., "<api-key>") with actual values for the application to
work correctly. While most of the fields should be self-explanatory,
the ~:wildfire-camera-api-key~ field may not be. This is simply an API
key for the [[http://alertwildfire.org][AlertWildfire]] API.

** Postgresql Database Setup

*PostgreSQL* needs to be installed on the machine that will be hosting
the Pyregence website. Once the Postgresql database server is running
on your machine, you should navigate to the toplevel directory and run
the database build command as follows:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:build-db build-all
#+end_src

This will begin by creating a new database and role called *pyregence*
and then add the pgcrypto and postgis extensions to it. Next, the
script will populate the database with the schemas, tables, and
functions that are necessary for storing and processing Pyregence's
data. Finally, it will load some default data into these tables that
is necessary for the website to function properly.

*** Performance Settings

If you want to improve the performance of your Postgresql server, one
way is to visit the [[https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/][pgtune]] website
and input your system settings. This will generate a set of configuration
options that you can add to the postgresql.conf file in your system-specific
Postgresql data directory.

If you would like to keep these settings separate for your own
reference, you can add them to a file called "performance.conf" that
you should place in your Postgresql data directory. You can then
import these settings into postgresql.conf by adding this line to the
end of that file:

#+begin_example
include = 'performance.conf'
#+end_example

Note that the Postgresql server will need to be restarted for these
changes to take effect.

** Environment Variable Setup

In order for your command line shell to find the programs installed
above, you will need to update your environment variables. Under
GNU/Linux, *BSD, or MacOS X, you can set these through your shell's
.*rc or .*profile configuration files in your $HOME directory. In a
Windows environment, you will need to set either the USER (for the
current user only) or SYSTEM (for any user) environment variables
under your system settings menu.

*** Step 1: Add JAVA_HOME

On a Unix machine using bash (e.g., GNU/Linux or MacOS X):

#+begin_src sh
export JAVA_HOME=<jdk-installation-directory>
#+end_src

On a Unix machine using csh or tcsh (e.g., *BSD):

#+begin_src sh
setenv JAVA_HOME <jdk-installation-directory>
#+end_src

On a Windows machine:

#+begin_example
JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-X.X.X
#+end_example

Replace *X.X.X* with the JDK version installed on your computer.

*** Step 2: Update PATH

On a Unix machine using bash (e.g., GNU/Linux or MacOS X):

#+begin_src sh
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
#+end_src

On a Unix machine using csh or tcsh (e.g., *BSD):

#+begin_src sh
setenv PATH $PATH\:$JAVA_HOME/bin
#+end_src

On a Windows machine, add these entries to the PATH environment
variable:

#+begin_example
%JAVA_HOME%\bin
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\X\lib
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\X\bin
#+end_example

Replace *X* with the PostgreSQL version installed on your computer.

** Development Web Server

*** Modifying hosts file

Add the following line to your hosts file. This local url will allows
for a natural URL in the browser.

#+begin_example
127.0.0.1 local.pyregence.org
#+end_example

*** Launching Figwheel

To start the Figwheel server, navigate to the toplevel project
directory and run:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:figwheel
#+end_src

This will start a web server on http://local.pyregence.org:8080 (also
accessible from http://localhost:8080), which serves up the website in
dev mode. Any changes to CLJS files will be automatically pushed to
the browser when the files are saved. Any changes to CLJ files will be
pushed to the running server process. A CLJS browser REPL will also be
launched at the terminal for you to interactively develop your
client-side code.

*** Checking for Reflection Warnings

From the toplevel project directory run:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:check-reflection
#+end_src

This will emit warnings when reflection is needed to resolve Java
method calls or field accesses. To resolve any that appear, add
[[https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop#typehints][type hints]] to your code. Resolving all reflection warnings can improve
system performance.

** Production Web Server

*** Installation Requirements

- [[https://certbot.eff.org/][certbot]]
- [[https://www.openssl.org/source/][openssl]]

*** Enabling https

View the [[https://github.com/sig-gis/triangulum#triangulumhttps][Triangulum HTTPS]]
page for further instructions on enabling HTTPS.

*** Compiling Clojurescript to Javascript

To compile the Clojurescript files under src/cljs to Javascript under
target/public/cljs, navigate to the toplevel project directory and
run:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:compile-cljs
#+end_src

The main Javascript entry point file will be written to
target/public/cljs/app.js. The Clojurescript compiler options are read
from the toplevel compile-prod.cljs.edn file.

*** Launching the Web Server

To compile and run the web application, navigate to the toplevel
project directory and run:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:build-db functions
clojure -M:run-server -m [dev|prod] [-p 8080] [-P 8443]
#+end_src

The website will then be available at http://localhost:8080 unless a
port is specified. An http port can be specified with -p and an https
port can be specified with -P. In dev mode, server-side exceptions
will be displayed in the browser and Clojure source files will be
reloaded whenever you refresh the page. These features are disabled in
prod mode. If -m is unspecified, it will default to prod mode.

If you don't already have an SSL certificate, you cannot specify an
https port.

*** Running the Web Server as a System Service

View the [[https://github.com/sig-gis/triangulum#triangulumsystemd][Triangulum Systemd]]
page for further instructions on enabling the app as a system service.

*** Maintaining Daily Logs

By default the server will log to standard out. If you would like to
have the system log to YYYY-DD-MM.log, use the "-o path" option to
specify an output path. You can either specify a path relative to
the toplevel directory of this repository or an absolute path on
your filesystem. The logger will keep the 10 most recent logs.

*** Running https via nginx (optional)

**** Install required packages

- [[https://nginx.org/en/][nginx]]

**** Copy the nginx template and update

Ubuntu example:

#+begin_src sh
sudo cp nginx/nginx-template.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/pyregence.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pyregence.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pyregence.conf
sudo service nginx restart
#+end_src

**** Alternative server deployment

When using nginx, run the server in http mode only.  If multiple servers are
running on the same VM, be sure to assign them different ports.  Remember that
nginx needs port 8080, witch is the default port for the server deployment.
Instead deploy with a non default port:

#+begin_src sh
clojure -M:run-server -p 8081
#+end_src

For HTTPS, each server does not need its own deploy hook. Instead nginx needs
a single deploy hook:

#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/nginx.sh
#+end_src

Add ~systemctl reload nginx~ to the file and save.

#+begin_src sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/nginx.sh
#+end_src

**** Diagnose errors with nginx by looking in the log

Ubuntu example:

#+begin_src sh
sudo less +G /var/log/nginx/error.log
#+end_src
